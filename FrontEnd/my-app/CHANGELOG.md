## Section Legend

Each release block uses the following ordered sections (omit empty ones):

| Section                         | Use for                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **💥 Breaking — Types/Models**  | Any incompatible change to a TypeScript type, interface, enum, Zod schema, or API response shape |
| **💥 Breaking — Runtime/API**   | Any incompatible runtime behaviour, route, prop, or env-var change                               |
| **✨ Added**                    | New features, types, hooks, or models (additive only)                                            |
| **🛠 Changed**                  | Backwards-compatible changes to existing behaviour                                               |
| **⚠️ Deprecated**               | Soon-to-be-removed types or APIs                                                                 |

Every **💥 Breaking — Types/Models** entry must include:

1. The fully-qualified symbol (e.g. `lib/types/quest.ts → QuestStatus`).

## [Unreleased]

### 💥 Breaking — Types/Models

_None yet._

### ✨ Added

- **Guard against duplicate reward claims with in-flight lock in ClaimButton** ([#2150](https://github.com/EarnQuestOne/stellar_Earn/issues/2150)).
  - `components/rewards/ClaimButton.tsx` now maintains a synchronous in-flight lock that disables the button and ignores repeated presses while a claim request is pending.
  - Added unit regression tests in `components/rewards/__tests__/ClaimButton.test.tsx`.
  - Added benchmark script `scripts/benchmarks/claim-button.bench.tsx` demonstrating 100% duplicate claim transaction prevention and RPC/API call reduction.
- **Skeleton loading states for async card grids** ([FE-050](https://github.com/Kappa16/stellar_Earn/issues/050)).
  - Improved user experience with loading state indicators while fetching data.
  - Enhanced API client and validation modules for better async handling.
- **Frontend changelog policy** for breaking type / model changes
  ([FE-068](https://github.com/Kappa16/stellar_Earn/issues/068)).
    - New canonical `FrontEnd/my-app/CHANGELOG.md` (this file).
      - New policy document at
          [`docs/TYPE_CHANGES_POLICY.md`](./docs/TYPE_CHANGES_POLICY.md).
            - New lightweight changeset workflow under
                [`.changeset/`](./.changeset/README.md).
                  - New CI guard
                      [`scripts/check-changelog.mjs`](./scripts/check-changelog.mjs) wired into
                          `npm run changelog:check` and the
                              [`frontend-changelog.yml`](../../.github/workflows/frontend-changelog.yml)
                                  workflow.
- **React Query (`@tanstack/react-query`) integration for server-state caching** ([#2034](https://github.com/EarnQuestOne/stellar_Earn/issues/2034)).
  - Installed `@tanstack/react-query` v5 and wired a shared `QueryClient` into `RootProviders` so all hooks share one in-memory cache.
  - `lib/query/client.ts` - pre-configured `QueryClient` (60 s stale, 5 min gc, 2 retries, no window-focus refetch by default).
  - `lib/query/keys.ts` - centralized key factories for quests, submissions, reputation, user stats, and profile enabling targeted cache invalidation.
  - `lib/hooks/useQuests` migrated from manual Zustand+`useEffect` to `useQuery`. Duplicate renders for the same filter set no longer fire duplicate network requests.
  - `lib/hooks/useSubmissions` migrated to `useQuery`; optimistic updates now write directly to the React Query cache.
  - `lib/hooks/useReputation` replaced the TODO stub with a real `useQuery` call against `/api/reputation/:userId`; disabled automatically when no `userId` is provided.
  - `lib/hooks/useUserStats` and its individual sub-hooks (`useStats`, `useActiveQuests`, `useRecentSubmissions`, `useEarningsHistory`, `useBadges`) migrated from per-hook `useState`/`useEffect` to `useQuery`.
  - Per-query `staleTime` tuning: quests 2 min, submissions 30 s, reputation 5 min, dashboard 60 s, badges 5 min.

  **Before/after network request count (quests page, measured via Chrome DevTools Network panel):**

  | Scenario | Before | After |
  | -------- | ------ | ----- |
  | Two components mount and both call `useQuests({status:'Active'})` | 2 GET `/quests` | 1 GET `/quests` (deduplicated by React Query) |
  | Navigate away and back within stale window | 1 GET `/quests` on each visit | 0 (served from cache; background revalidation only after 2 min) |
  | Filter change (new query key) | 1 GET `/quests` | 1 GET `/quests` (no change; each distinct key still fetches once) |

- **`lib/api/submissions.ts` — `submitProof` helper** ([#1688](https://github.com/EarnQuestOne/stellar_Earn/issues/1688)).
  - New exported function that wraps the upload-then-create flow for quest proof submission.
  - For file proofs larger than 5 MB, calls `uploadProofFile` first (with progress tracking via XHR) then forwards the resulting IPFS URL to `createSubmission`; smaller proofs are inlined directly.
  - Consumed by the new `components/submission/SubmissionForm` multi-step form component.

- **Admin quest table pagination + memoized rows** ([#2166](https://github.com/EarnQuestOne/stellar_Earn/issues/2166)).
  - `components/admin/QuestTable.tsx` now paginates client-side (10 / 25 / 50 / 100 rows per page) instead of rendering every quest at once, with Previous / Next controls and a page-range readout.
  - Rows are extracted into a `React.memo`'d `QuestTableRow` and `QuestRowActions` is memoized; row action callbacks are stabilized with `useCallback` so a single checkbox toggle or sort change no longer rebuilds every row.
  - Added a benchmark harness (`scripts/benchmarks/quest-table.render.bench.tsx`, run via `npm run benchmark:quest-table`) with before/after measurements committed under `scripts/benchmarks/results/`.

  **Before/after (jsdom render benchmark, 3 iterations, min timings):**

  | Dataset | Metric | Before | After | Speed-up |
  | ------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | -------- |
  | 200 quests | Mount | 237.84 ms | 22.79 ms | ~10x |
  | 200 quests | Selection update | 181.18 ms | 7.97 ms | ~23x |
  | 1000 quests | Mount | 856.12 ms | 15.13 ms | ~57x |
  | 1000 quests | Selection update | 535.67 ms | 7.31 ms | ~73x |
  | 1000 quests | Rows mounted | 1000 | 10 | flat (page-size bound) |

### 🛠 Changed

- Updated root [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) and the
  [PR template](../../.github/pull_request_template.md) with a "Breaking
  Type/Model Changes" checklist that links to this changelog.

### ⚠️ Deprecated

_None yet._

### 🗑 Removed

_None yet._

### 🐛 Fixed

- Optimized image rendering now reserves intrinsic space with an aspect ratio so media placeholders do not trigger layout shift while assets load.
- Tests: updated `lib/api/client.test.ts` to include response-interceptor tests for token-refresh failures.

### 🔒 Security

_None yet._

## Worked Example — How to Document a Breaking Type Change

> The following block is **illustrative only** — keep it at the bottom of the
> file forever as a template for new contributors.

```markdown
## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-15

### 💥 Breaking — Types/Models

- **`lib/types/quest.ts → QuestStatus`** — renamed `PAUSED` to `ON_HOLD` to
  match the new contract event name. (#412)

  **Migration:**

  ```ts
  // before
  import { QuestStatus } from '@/lib/types';
  if (quest.status === QuestStatus.PAUSED) { … }

  // after
  import { QuestStatus } from '@/lib/types';
  if (quest.status === QuestStatus.ON_HOLD) { … }
  ```

- **`lib/types/api.types.ts → PaginationMeta`** — `cursor` is now required
  (was optional). All consumers must pass a cursor when paginating. (#418)

  **Migration:**

  ```ts
  // before
  const meta: PaginationMeta = { page: 1, limit: 20, total: 0, totalPages: 0, hasMore: false };

  // after
  const meta: PaginationMeta = { page: 1, limit: 20, total: 0, totalPages: 0, hasMore: false, cursor: '' };
  ```
```
